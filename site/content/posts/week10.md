# Log: Week 10

This week I have been researching cooperative genetic algorithms. I need to find a way to co-evolve multiple routes that do not collide at any given time $t$. I need to also work out the best way to implement velocity in my system. One approach would be to add it to the genotype and therefore evolve the velocity at the same time as the position of the control points. A simpler, placeholder implementation is to have velocity as a constant set on an agent-by-agent basis. This would allow for easier intersection detection.

I have also been working on my report. Specifically, the introduction and backgrounds sections. The background section is almost complete although it will need to be expanded if and when I implement different genetic operators. In my introduction section I am trying for formally identify my project goal and decompose it into more manageble tasks. This was part of my feedback from my Project Review.
