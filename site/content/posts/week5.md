# Log: Week 5

This week I have been focusing on preparing for my presentation. In doing so, I have found that I needed to research the real-world systems currently in place to critique and justify my research. I have been going through government publications to find data related to congestion and delays on UK Motorways.
Much of the data is several years old so I may need to look to more general examples from other countries with similar systems around the world. Perhaps a small case study on the Autobahn to justify increased speeds etc.

I have also been working on the overview section of my report, I hope to have a preliminary version finished next week, allowing me to move onto the Literature Review section. I have gathered a substantial number of papers already but feel I will need to research the more general area of road-network planning in order to justify my choice of specialisation.
