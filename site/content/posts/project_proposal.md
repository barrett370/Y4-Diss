## Topic

My proposed topic of research is the application of (Quantum) Genetic Algorithms on a theoretical, fully autonomous, decentralised car & road network.

## Problem/ Question Definition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points to incorporate into question:

- Accelerated development of self-driving cars
- Current solutions are largely _self-obsessed_
  - by making certain roads compliant to a standard, we can start introducing swarm behaviour
- We are heading towards a computational renaissance with the advent of widespread quantum computation, applications of such systems on vehicle routing should be examined and evaluated

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The question I would attempt to answer would be:

> With the advent of both autonomous road networks and wide-spread quantum computation on the horizon, can we apply genetic algorithms to solve th

## Methods/ Approach

- Research recently published papers on the topics involved.
- Research the implications of such a system
