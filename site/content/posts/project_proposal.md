## Topic

My proposed topic of research is the application of (Quantum) Genetic Algorithms and/or Swarm Algorithms on a theoretical, fully autonomous, decentralised car & road network.

## Problem/ Question Definition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points to incorporate into question:

- Accelerated development of self-driving cars
- Current solutions are largely _self-centered_
  - by making certain roads compliant to a standard protocol, we can start introducing swarm behaviour
- We are heading towards a computational renaissance with the advent of widespread quantum computation, applications of such systems on vehicle routing should be examined and evaluated

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The question I would attempt to answer would be:

> What is the suitability of (Q)GAs with regards to fully autonomous road networks? How well do they perform and how feasible are they to implement over the next 1,10 and 50 years?

Possible report title:

> Applications of GAs and QGAs on theoretical fully autonomous road networks

## Methods/ Approach

- Research recently published papers on the topics involved.
- Research the implications of such a system
- Initially focus on classical approaches
  - If going well extend to quantum aspects
  - If finding it more difficult, continue to focus on classical approach
- Attempt to implement and simulate a system (classically and then quantum)
- Discuss results
- Discuss viability & possibility of improvement in future years, what needs to change/ be improved for this to be feasible?
