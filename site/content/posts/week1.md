This week, I have been primarily concerned with researching possible project topics.

I had originally thought I would like to do research into nature inspired optimisation techniques and their potential applications in the world of fully autonomous road networks. Whilst this is still an area I am interested in, and would like to research, it has been suggested to me that it might be beneficial for me to choose a topic more closely related to my supervisor's field of study.

## Possible Topics

### Swarm Road Networks

This was my initial idea, I had thought I would look into and develop proof (or dis-proof) of concept algorithms which would attempt to plan routes in real time for a network (or swarm) of autonomous, inter-connected agents (modelling vehicles)

### Something _Quantum-y_

- [Quantum Applications on route finding and planning](https://www.dwavesys.com/sites/default/files/Quantum%20optimised%20planning%20%28with%20workplan%29.pdf), may allow to loop back in with Autonomous road network planning.
  - [VW research](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-optimizes-traffic-flow-with-quantum-computers-5507)
  - The area of Quantum Genetic Algorithms for path finding seems active. I have found a [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11280-018-0594-x#citeas) by Tian, Y et al. dated from 2019 on quantum route selection using a[n] (I)QGA
  
- According to [this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309214642_Quantum_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Computer_Scientists) paper, in a "RQGA, we can consider the population is made up of a single chromosome in a state of superposition" meaning the optimal solution (given enough qubits) is found in a single generation". This could have good applications within real-time systems such as self-driving cars.

## Plan for Next Week

My intention for next week is to continue to read around the subjects listed above, I have already collated ~5 papers related to GAs and QGAs.

Look into the current research & implementations of QGAs in programming languages, including the use of the Qiskit package for python.
