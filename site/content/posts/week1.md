This week, I have been primarily concerned with researching possible project topics.

I had originally thought I would like to do research into nature inspired optimisation techniques and their potential applications in the world of fully autonomous road networks. Whilst this is still an area I am interested in, and would like to research, it has been suggested to me that it might be beneficial for me to choose a topic more closely related to my supervisor's field of study.

## Possible Topics

### Swarm Road Networks

This was my initial idea, I had thought I would look into and develop proof (or dis-proof) of concept algorithms which would attempt to plan routes in real time for a network (or swarm) of autonomous, inter-connected agents (modelling vehicles) 


### Something _Quantum-y_

- [Quantum Applications on route finding and planning](https://www.dwavesys.com/sites/default/files/Quantum%20optimised%20planning%20%28with%20workplan%29.pdf), may allow to loop back in with Autonomous road network planning.

### Something related to complexity
