# Log: Week 6

This week I have:

- finished my presentation 
- Recorded it
- Continued work on the background section of my report
- Begun implenting utils for my GA experiments, namely:
  - Road Network struct & functions mapping Cartesian space onto road coordinate system
  - Plotting utils for _drawing_ the road and placing cartesian points in it
  - Structs encapsulating the phenotype and genotype of individuals
  - Functions to initialise a population of size $n$ with a route between 2 points.
  - Functions to plot candidate routes within the road space
  - Implementation of Bezier curves representing the genotype of the individual.
