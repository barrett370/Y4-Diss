  abstract = {In the "black box function optimization" problem, a search strategy is required to find an extremal point of a function without knowing the structure of the function or the range of possible function values. Solving such problems efficiently requires two abilities. On the one hand, a strategy must be capable of learning while searching: It must gather global information about the space and concentrate the search in the most promising regions. On the other hand, a strategy must be capable of sustained exploration: If a search of the most promising region does not uncover a satisfactory point, the strategy must redirect its efforts into other regions of the space. This dissertation describes a connectionist learning machine that produces a search strategy called stochastic iterated genetic hillclimb ing (SIGH). Viewed over a short period of time, SIGH displays a coarse-to-fine searching strategy, like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. However, in SIGH the convergence process is reversible. The connectionist implementation makes it possible to diverge the search after it has converged, and to recover coarse-grained informa tion about the space that was suppressed during convergence. The successful optimization of a complex function by SIGH usually in volves a series of such converge/diverge cycles.},

The problem of trajectory generation is firstly separated into generating continuous and bounded curvature profile to shape the trajectory and generating linear velocity profile to execute the trajectory. The curvature profile generation is further converted to an optimization problem with only 3 parameters owing to the specific properties of quartic B\'ezier curve. Sequential quadratic programming is employed to find optimal solution with respect to specific objective function. To avoid sideslip and ensure velocity-continuity and acceleration limits, the framework of linear velocity profile generation is also proposed.

  abstract = {Traffic jams in large cities, in addition to having a very high economic cost, cause an increase in emissions generated by vehicles over the same route being driven under normal conditions. In recent years, there has been a rapid evolution in the technologies applied to the field of autonomous vehicles. There are currently commercial solutions for assisted driving and semi-autonomous driving systems, with very favorable forecasts for reaching a completely autonomous vehicle scenario in the coming decades. This new environment generates opportunities and challenges to reduce congestion in scenarios with autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on the automatic optimization of the passage of vehicles through intersections. The intersections are one of the most conflict-generating elements in a traffic network. This type of conflicts arises because the intersections must manage multiple traffic flows with different priorities and preferences, often leading to traffic jams. The problem has been addressed by proposing three mechanisms to model any type of intersection, to calculate the roads with fewer points of conflict between their inputs and outputs, and to optimize the arrival rate of vehicles using a Genetic Algorithm to achieve the maximum performance of the intersection. To validate this solution, a cellular automata simulator has been developed, which can be adapted to both autonomous and conventional vehicle scenarios and can provide realistic results when certain conditions are met. The results obtained have been compared with other traditional solutions (priority and traffic lights) using microscopic traffic simulations, and with those obtained in other studies showing the advantages of the proposed system. The proposed systems achieve a throughput improvement between 9.21\% and 36.98\% compared with the traditional solutions.},

These two genetic algorithms are compared with two existing genetic algorithms (HX\textendash MPTM and HX\textendash NUM) which comprise of Heuristic Crossover operator and same two mutation operators. A set of 20 test problems available in the global optimization literature is used to test the performance of these four genetic algorithms. To judge the performance of the LX operator, two kinds of analysis is performed. Firstly a pair wise comparison is performed between LX\textendash MPTM and HX\textendash MPTM, and then between LX\textendash NUM and HX\textendash NUM. Secondly the overall comparison of performances of all the four genetic algorithms is carried out based on a performance index (PI). The comparative study shows that Laplace crossover (LX) performs quite well and one of the genetic algorithms defined (LX\textendash MPTM) outperforms other genetic algorithms.},

In particular, if a B\'ezier curve is subdivided into some number of pieces, then the arc-length of the original curve is greater than the sum of the chord-lengths of the pieces, and less than the sum of the polygon-lengths of the pieces. Under repeated subdivisions, the difference between this lower and upper bound gets arbitrarily small. If Lc denotes the total chord-length of the pieces and Lp denotes the total polygon-length of the pieces, the best estimate of the true arc-length is (2Lc + (n - 1)Lp)(n + 1), where n is the degree of the B\'ezier curve. This convex combination of Lc and Lp is best in the sense that the error goes to zero under repeated subdivision asymptotically faster than the error of any other convex combination, and it forms the basis for a fast adaptive algorithm, which determines the arc-length of a B\'ezier curve. The energy of a curve is half the square of the curvature integrated with respect to arc-length. Like in the case of the arc-length, it is possible to use the chord-length and polygon-length of the pieces of a subdivided B\'ezier curve to estimate the energy of the B\'ezier curve.},

Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.},

Evolutionary algorithms are a conventional method to solve complex optimization problems with multiple constraints. However, they are time-consuming algorithms which make their implementation difficult. UAV path planning is usually a real-time problem that is needed to solve in limited time steps. Parallelization is one of the most effective methods for reducing the computation time of evolutionary algorithms. In the industrial applications, usually there is a communication platform between devices which can be used for the implementation of the parallelization process. For example, controller area network (CAN) is a protocol used for reliable communication in aerospace systems. Due to the development of this protocol on UAVs and its characteristics, it can be used for parallel optimization of path planning problem. In this paper, an asynchronous distributed multi-master parallel genetic algorithm and a parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm are implemented on CAN bus to improve the speed and performance of the UAV path planning.},

Such travel is visible in a number of countries e.g. India, wherein it enables a higher traffic bandwidth, more overtaking and more efficient travel. These advantages are visible when the vehicles vary considerably in size and speed, in the absence of which the predefined lanes are near-optimal. Motion planning for multiple autonomous vehicles in unorganized traffic deals with deciding on the manner in which every vehicle travels, ensuring no collision either with each other or with static obstacles. In this paper the notion of predefined lanes is generalized to model unorganized travel for the purpose of planning vehicles travel. A uniform cost search is used for finding the optimal motion strategy of a vehicle, amidst the known travel plans of the other vehicles. The aim is to maximize the separation between the vehicles and static obstacles. The search is responsible for defining an optimal lane distribution among vehicles in the planning scenario. Clothoid curves are used for maintaining a lane or changing lanes. Experiments are performed by simulation over a set of challenging scenarios with a complex grid of obstacles. Additionally behaviours of overtaking, waiting for a vehicle to cross and following another vehicle are exhibited.},

  abstract = {Planning is one of the key problems for autonomous vehicles operating in road scenarios. Present planning algorithms operate with the assumption that traffic is organised in predefined speed lanes, which makes it impossible to allow autonomous vehicles in countries with unorganised traffic. Unorganised traffic is though capable of higher traffic bandwidths when constituting vehicles vary in their speed capabilities and sizes. Diverse vehicles in an unorganised exhibit unique driving behaviours which are analysed in this paper by a simulation study. The aim of the work reported here is to create a planning algorithm for mixed traffic consisting of both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles without any inter-vehicle communication. The awareness (e.g. vision) of every vehicle is restricted to nearby vehicles only and a straight infinite road is assumed for decision making regarding navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles. Exhibited behaviours include obstacle avoidance, overtaking, giving way for vehicles to overtake from behind, vehicle following, adjusting the lateral lane position and so on. A conflict of plans is a major issue which will almost certainly arise in the absence of inter-vehicle communication. Hence each vehicle needs to continuously track other vehicles and rectify plans whenever a collision seems likely. Further it is observed here that driver aggression plays a vital role in overall traffic dynamics, hence this has also been factored in accordingly. This work is hence a step forward towards achieving autonomous vehicles in unorganised traffic, while similar effort would be required for planning problems such as intersections, mergers, diversions and other modules like localisation.},

TCA models arise from the physics discipline of statistical mechanics, having the goal of reproducing the correct macroscopic behaviour based on a minimal description of microscopic interactions. After giving an overview of cellular automata (CA) models, their background and physical setup, we introduce the mathematical notations, show how to perform measurements on a TCA model's lattice of cells, as well as how to convert these quantities into real-world units and vice versa. The majority of this paper then relays an extensive account of the behavioural aspects of several TCA models encountered in literature. Already, several reviews of TCA models exist, but none of them consider all the models exclusively from the behavioural point of view. In this respect, our overview fills this void, as it focusses on the behaviour of the TCA models, by means of time\textendash space and phase-space diagrams, and histograms showing the distributions of vehicles' speeds, space, and time gaps. In the report, we subsequently give a concise overview of TCA models that are employed in a multi-lane setting, and some of the TCA models used to describe city traffic as a two-dimensional grid of cells, or as a road network with explicitly modelled intersections. The final part of the paper illustrates some of the more common analytical approximations to single-cell TCA models.},

The model consists of the rough sets based heart disease feature selection module and the fuzzy rule based classification module. The generated rules from fuzzy classifiers are optimized by applying the adaptive genetic algorithm. First, important features which effect heart disease are selected by rough set theory.

  abstract = {Military unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in highly dynamic environments and must often adjust their trajectories based on the evolving situation. To operate autonomously and safely, a UAV must be equipped with a path planning module capable of quickly recalculating a feasible and quasi-optimal path in flight while in the event a new obstacle or threat has been detected or simply if the destination point is changed during the mission. To allow for a fast path planning, this paper proposes a parallel implementation of the genetic algorithm on graphics processing unit (GPU). The trajectories are built as series of line segments connected by circular arcs resulting in smooth paths suitable for fixed-wing UAVs. The fitness function we defined takes into account the dynamic constraints of the UAVs and aims to minimize fuel consumption and average flying altitude in order to improve range and avoid detection by enemy radars. This fitness function is also implemented on the GPU and different parallelization strategies were developed and tested for each step of the fitness evaluation. By exploiting the massively parallel architecture of GPUs, the execution time of the proposed path planner was reduced by a factor of 290x compared to a sequential execution on CPU. The path planning module developed was tested using 18 scenarios on six realistic three-dimensional terrains with multiple no-fly zones. We found that the proposed GPU-based path planner was able to find quasi-optimal solutions in a timely fashion allowing in-flight planning.},

Pozzolans have been utilized as partially replacement for Portland cement or blended cement in concrete based on the materials' properties and the concrete's desired effects. Several environmental problems associated with producing cement have led to partial replacement of cement with other pozzolans. Furnace slag and fly ash are two of the pozzolans which can be appropriately used as partial replacements for cement in concrete. However, replacing cement with these materials results in significant changes in the mechanical properties of concrete, more specifically, compressive strength. This paper aims to intelligently predict the compressive strength of concretes incorporating furnace slag and fly ash as partial replacements for cement. For this purpose, a database containing 1030 data sets with nine inputs (concrete mix design and age of concrete) and one output (the compressive strength) was collected. Instead of absolute values of inputs, their proportions were used. A hybrid artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) was employed as a novel approach to conducting the study. The performance of the ANN-GA model is evaluated by another artificial neural network (ANN), which was developed and tuned via a conventional backpropagation (BP) algorithm. Results showed that not only an ANN-GA model can be developed and appropriately used for the compressive strength prediction of concrete but also it can lead to superior results in comparison with an ANN-BP model.},

The only way to analyze such phenomena is through the development of models that can simulate behavior of every agent. Agent-based modeling is an approach based on the idea that a system is composed of decentralized individual `agents' and that each agent interacts with other agents according to localized knowledge. The agent-based approach is a `bottom-up' approach to modeling where special kinds of artificial agents are created by analogy with social insects. Social insects (including bees, wasps, ants and termites) have lived on Earth for millions of years. Their behavior in nature is primarily characterized by autonomy, distributed functioning and self-organizing capacities. Social insect colonies teach us that very simple individual organisms can form systems capable of performing highly complex tasks by dynamically interacting with each other. On the other hand, a large number of traditional engineering models and algorithms are based on control and centralization. In this article, we try to obtain the answer to the following question: Can we use some principles of natural swarm intelligence in the development of artificial systems aimed at solving complex problems in traffic and transportation?},

It turns out that the genetic strategy is not particularly helpful in our quantum computation approach; therefore our solution consists of designing a special-purpose oracle that will work with a modified version of an already known algorithm (maximum finding [1]), in order to reduce the QGAs to a Grover search. Quantum computation offers incentives for this approach, due to the fact that the qubit representation of the chromosome can encode the entire population as a superposition of basis-state values.},

  abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAV) are marketed for their increased safety, driving comfort, and time saving potential. With much easier access to information, increased processing power, and precision control, they also offer unprecedented opportunities for energy efficient driving. This paper is an attempt to highlight the energy saving potential of connected and automated vehicles based on first principles of motion, optimal control theory, and a review of the vast but scattered eco-driving literature. We explain that connectivity to other vehicles and infrastructure allows better anticipation of upcoming events, such as hills, curves, slow traffic, state of traffic signals, and movement of neighboring vehicles. Automation allows vehicles to adjust their motion more precisely in anticipation of upcoming events, and save energy. Opportunities for cooperative driving could further increase energy efficiency of a group of vehicles by allowing them to move in a coordinated manner. Energy efficient motion of connected and automated vehicles could have a harmonizing effect on mixed traffic, leading to additional energy savings for neighboring vehicles.},

  abstract = {Experts predict that new automobiles will be capable of driving themselves under limited conditions within 5\textendash 10years, and under most conditions within 10\textendash 20years. Automation may affect road vehicle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a host of ways, positive and negative, by causing changes in travel demand, vehicle design, vehicle operating profiles, and choices of fuels. In this paper, we identify specific mechanisms through which automation may affect travel and energy demand and resulting GHG emissions and bring them together using a coherent energy decomposition framework. We review the literature for estimates of the energy impacts of each mechanism and, where the literature is lacking, develop our own estimates using engineering and economic analysis. We consider how widely applicable each mechanism is, and quantify the potential impact of each mechanism on a common basis: the percentage change it is expected to cause in total GHG emissions from light-duty or heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. Our primary focus is travel related energy consumption and emissions, since potential lifecycle impacts are generally smaller in magnitude. We explore the net effects of automation on emissions through several illustrative scenarios, finding that automation might plausibly reduce road transport GHG emissions and energy use by nearly half \textendash{} or nearly double them \textendash{} depending on which effects come to dominate. We also find that many potential energy-reduction benefits may be realized through partial automation, while the major energy/emission downside risks appear more likely at full automation. We close by presenting some implications for policymakers and identifying priority areas for further research.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles promise to improve traffic safety while, at the same time, increase fuel efficiency and reduce congestion. They represent the main trend in future intelligent transportation systems. This paper concentrates on the planning problem of autonomous vehicles in traffic. We model the interaction between the autonomous vehicle and the environment as a stochastic Markov decision process (MDP) and consider the driving style of an expert driver as the target to be learned. The road geometry is taken into consideration in the MDP model in order to incorporate more diverse driving styles. The desired, expert-like driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle is obtained as follows: First, we design the reward function of the corresponding MDP and determine the optimal driving strategy for the autonomous vehicle using reinforcement learning techniques. Second, we collect a number of demonstrations from an expert driver and learn the optimal driving strategy based on data using inverse reinforcement learning. The unknown reward function of the expert driver is approximated using a deep neural-network (DNN). We clarify and validate the application of the maximum entropy principle (MEP) to learn the DNN reward function, and provide the necessary derivations for using the maximum entropy principle to learn a parameterized feature (reward) function. Simulated results demonstrate the desired driving behaviors of an autonomous vehicle using both the reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning techniques.},
