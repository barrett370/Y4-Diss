  abstract = {Traffic jams in large cities, in addition to having a very high economic cost, cause an increase in emissions generated by vehicles over the same route being driven under normal conditions. In recent years, there has been a rapid evolution in the technologies applied to the field of autonomous vehicles. There are currently commercial solutions for assisted driving and semi-autonomous driving systems, with very favorable forecasts for reaching a completely autonomous vehicle scenario in the coming decades. This new environment generates opportunities and challenges to reduce congestion in scenarios with autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on the automatic optimization of the passage of vehicles through intersections. The intersections are one of the most conflict-generating elements in a traffic network. This type of conflicts arises because the intersections must manage multiple traffic flows with different priorities and preferences, often leading to traffic jams. The problem has been addressed by proposing three mechanisms to model any type of intersection, to calculate the roads with fewer points of conflict between their inputs and outputs, and to optimize the arrival rate of vehicles using a Genetic Algorithm to achieve the maximum performance of the intersection. To validate this solution, a cellular automata simulator has been developed, which can be adapted to both autonomous and conventional vehicle scenarios and can provide realistic results when certain conditions are met. The results obtained have been compared with other traditional solutions (priority and traffic lights) using microscopic traffic simulations, and with those obtained in other studies showing the advantages of the proposed system. The proposed systems achieve a throughput improvement between 9.21\% and 36.98\% compared with the traditional solutions.},

  abstract = {Unorganized traffic is a generalized form of travel wherein vehicles do not adhere to any predefined lanes and can travel in-between lanes. Such travel is visible in a number of countries e.g. India, wherein it enables a higher traffic bandwidth, more overtaking and more efficient travel. These advantages are visible when the vehicles vary considerably in size and speed, in the absence of which the predefined lanes are near-optimal. Motion planning for multiple autonomous vehicles in unorganized traffic deals with deciding on the manner in which every vehicle travels, ensuring no collision either with each other or with static obstacles. In this paper the notion of predefined lanes is generalized to model unorganized travel for the purpose of planning vehicles travel. A uniform cost search is used for finding the optimal motion strategy of a vehicle, amidst the known travel plans of the other vehicles. The aim is to maximize the separation between the vehicles and static obstacles. The search is responsible for defining an optimal lane distribution among vehicles in the planning scenario. Clothoid curves are used for maintaining a lane or changing lanes. Experiments are performed by simulation over a set of challenging scenarios with a complex grid of obstacles. Additionally behaviours of overtaking, waiting for a vehicle to cross and following another vehicle are exhibited.},

  abstract = {Planning is one of the key problems for autonomous vehicles operating in road scenarios. Present planning algorithms operate with the assumption that traffic is organised in predefined speed lanes, which makes it impossible to allow autonomous vehicles in countries with unorganised traffic. Unorganised traffic is though capable of higher traffic bandwidths when constituting vehicles vary in their speed capabilities and sizes. Diverse vehicles in an unorganised exhibit unique driving behaviours which are analysed in this paper by a simulation study. The aim of the work reported here is to create a planning algorithm for mixed traffic consisting of both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles without any inter-vehicle communication. The awareness (e.g. vision) of every vehicle is restricted to nearby vehicles only and a straight infinite road is assumed for decision making regarding navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles. Exhibited behaviours include obstacle avoidance, overtaking, giving way for vehicles to overtake from behind, vehicle following, adjusting the lateral lane position and so on. A conflict of plans is a major issue which will almost certainly arise in the absence of inter-vehicle communication. Hence each vehicle needs to continuously track other vehicles and rectify plans whenever a collision seems likely. Further it is observed here that driver aggression plays a vital role in overall traffic dynamics, hence this has also been factored in accordingly. This work is hence a step forward towards achieving autonomous vehicles in unorganised traffic, while similar effort would be required for planning problems such as intersections, mergers, diversions and other modules like localisation.},

Each candidate is converted to a Cartesian coordinate system and evaluated using obstacle data. To select the optimal path, the priority of each path is determined by considering the path safety cost, path smoothness, and path consistency.

In QGOA, the classical fitness evaluation and selection procedures are replaced by a single quantum procedure. While the quantum and classical genetic algorithms use the same number of generations, the QGOA requires fewer operations to identify the high-fitness subpopulation at each generation. We show that the complexity of our QGOA is in terms of number of oracle calls in the selection procedure. Such theoretical results are confirmed by the simulations of the algorithm.},

Field analysis has been done to analyze the driver's reaction in order to avoid collision in real environment, so that our proposed algorithm gives decisions accordingly.

The only way to analyze such phenomena is through the development of models that can simulate behavior of every agent. Agent-based modeling is an approach based on the idea that a system is composed of decentralized individual `agents' and that each agent interacts with other agents according to localized knowledge. The agent-based approach is a `bottom-up' approach to modeling where special kinds of artificial agents are created by analogy with social insects. Social insects (including bees, wasps, ants and termites) have lived on Earth for millions of years. Their behavior in nature is primarily characterized by autonomy, distributed functioning and self-organizing capacities. Social insect colonies teach us that very simple individual organisms can form systems capable of performing highly complex tasks by dynamically interacting with each other. On the other hand, a large number of traditional engineering models and algorithms are based on control and centralization. In this article, we try to obtain the answer to the following question: Can we use some principles of natural swarm intelligence in the development of artificial systems aimed at solving complex problems in traffic and transportation?},
