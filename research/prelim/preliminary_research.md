# Preliminary Research

In this document I will be outlining my preliminary research for my dissertation, this may include possible topics and related research. 

I am intending to produce a _blog post_ each week to document my dissertation progress. This will either detail papers I have read, topics I have researched, algorithms I have implemented or sections I have written up.
