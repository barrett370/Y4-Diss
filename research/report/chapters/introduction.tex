\section{Goals}

The overarching goal of this project is to optimally route traffic in the setting of a fully-autonomous road system. This however, is an aspirational goal with many sub-requirements to be fulfilled before it can come to fruition.

Formally this top-level goal can be said to be to answer the question \hyperref[prob:Spec]{Problem~\ref{prob:Spec}}.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item A road system $\mathcal{R}$ represented as a graph $G = (V,E)$ 


                    Where each edge $e \in E$ is a section of road defined as the space bounded by two functions $b_1(x)$ and $b_2(x)$ augmented by a set of obstacles $O$ representing infeasible sections of road space
                \item a set of agents, $A = \left\{ a_1,\ldots,a_n \right\}$
                \item a set of routes as vertex pairs: 

                    $\mathcal{V} = \left\{ (V_1^1,V_1^2),\ldots, (V_n^1, V_n^2) \right\}, V_{i \in [1 \ldots n]}^{j \in [1,2]} \in V$ 

                where the route for agent $a_i$ is from vertex $V_i^1$ to $V_i^2$
