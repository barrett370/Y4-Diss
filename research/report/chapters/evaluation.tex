\subsection{Bézier Curves}
\todo[inline]{expand on this section, talk about issues of finding intersection, possible GPU applications}

Bézier curves have been utlised in this project to encode and represent the route of a vehicle. As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:back-bezier-curves}, there are many reasons I originally selected them for this task. However, over the course of implementation and testing, a number of downsides have been presented.
