# Log: Week 4

This week, whilst awaiting feedback on my project proposal, I have been continuing to research and compile papers related to my proposed field of study. I have found the papers predating the book I had started reading, these included very helpful definitions of how the road spaces were represented using a separate set of basis functions defined within the standard Cartesian coordinate system.

I have attempted to implement this road system in Julia, and whilst it appears to work, I expect there to be many tweaks needed once the core GA is implemented and tied into it.

Next week, I am intending to read over the newly available exemplar projects in order to get more of an idea as to what is expected of my report. I will then begin the process of writing the first draft of my literature review section.
