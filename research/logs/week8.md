# Log: Week 8

This week I have:

- Implemented basic/ placeholder genetic operators
- These allow the algorithm to accurately learn/ approximate straight line routes from $A \rightarrow B$

Below you can see the population after 1 generation:

And the most and least fit solutions after 4 generations

Whilst in isolation this is not particularly impressive, in fact is under performs a simple Pythagorean distance calculation, it can be generalised and extended to avoid obstacles and to not intersect with other routes.
