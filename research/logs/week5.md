# Log: Week 5

This week I have been focusing on preparing for my presentation. In doing so, I have found that I needed to research the real-world systems currently in place to critique and justify my research. I have been going through government publications to find data related to congestion and delays on UK Motorways.
Much of the data is several years old so I may need to look to more general examples from other countries with similar systems around the world. Perhaps a small case study on the Autobahn to justify increased speeds etc.



Discuss:

- Not sure how information dense the presentation should be, it is only 5 mins but is 10% so don't want to underdo it and lose marks
