# Log : Week 7


This week I have been continuing to work on the programmatic implementation of my project. I have implemented population generation and the GA up to the selection phase. Performance of curve generation seems good, plotting is the slowest part by far and that would not occur in a deployed application of the system. 

I have also been responding to feedback on my presentation & re-recoding it ready for submission on Friday.




## Questions

- Specific problems: Real-world or theoretical ? 
A: Talk about how plotting curves solves the problem outlined.
