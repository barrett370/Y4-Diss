#+TITLE: Semester 2, Week2 0

This week I am looking into parallelising my current processes. Currently, I am plan concurrent routes for a set of agents. However, this planning happens sequentially in both generations and agents, leading to a very time consuming process.

I will be looking into the possibility of:

- Parallelising the individual generation generation
- Ways to parallelise the multi-agents learning through the use of channels through which the current state of planning of each agents can be shared between threads. There is a possibility this will result in routes that collide. Depending on performance, this could still be a viable initial planning stage followed by checks and re-planning where necessary.
