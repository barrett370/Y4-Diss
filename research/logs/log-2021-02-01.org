#+TITLE: Log: Week 1
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

This week I have:

- Re-familiarised myself with my code base & what I have implemented up until to now
- Implemented a linear ranked selection function of the same shape as the existing roulette wheel (fitness proportional) selection.
  + I have also reworked the ~GA~ and ~CGA~ function types to allow for specification of selection operator and ranking function of ~ranked_selection~.
- Working on parellelising ~bezInt~ function, currently runs ~async~ allowing for better average case runtime but running on multiple threads will increase speedup further. Currently this method alone results in a ~50x slowdown!
