* Log: Week 1

#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
This week I have:

- Re-familiarised myself with my code base & what I have implemented up until to now
- Implemented a linear ranked selection function of the same shape as the existing roulette wheel (fitness proportional) selection.
  + I have also reworked the ~GA~ and ~CGA~ function types to allow for specification of selection operator and ranking function of ~ranked_selection~ .
