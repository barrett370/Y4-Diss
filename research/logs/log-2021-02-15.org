#+TITLE: Log Week 3
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

 This week I have been working on:

 - The background section of my report, updating the genetic operators section to include my newly implemented operators.
   Also, upon adding the equations for de Casteljau's algorithm, I realised my implementation was incorrect and spent a few hours working out where I went wrong and correcting it.
 - The literature review section of my report. I am unsure as to how much detail to include when critically evaluating papers, I would appreciate some feedback on section 3.1.1 of [[https://sambarrett.online/Y4-Diss/report.pdf][my report]].
