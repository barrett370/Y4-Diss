<p>I had originally thought I would like to do research into nature inspired optimisation techniques and their potential applications in the world of fully autonomous road networks.

<h2 id="possible-topics">Possible Topics</h2>
<h3 id="swarm-road-networks">Swarm Road Networks</h3>
<p>This was my initial idea, I had thought I would look into and develop proof (or dis-proof) of concept algorithms which would attempt to plan routes in real time for a network (or swarm) of autonomous, inter-connected agents (modelling vehicles)</p>
<h3 id="something-_quantum-y_">Something <em>Quantum-y</em></h3>

<li><a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-optimizes-traffic-flow-with-quantum-computers-5507">VW research</a></li>
<li>The area of Quantum Genetic Algorithms for path finding seems active. I have found a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11280-018-0594-x#citeas"> paper </a> by Tian, Y et al. dated from 2019 on quantum route selection using a (I)QGA</li>
