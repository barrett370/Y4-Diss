<p>I have started using Zotoro to keep track of any papers I have found. I am annotating papers as I read them so as to help me when I come to reference certain sections.</p>
<p>Papers Read:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxye.bham.ac.uk/abstract/document/4358783">Quantum Genetic Optimization</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/5/4/24">Quantum Genetic Algorithms for Computer Scientists</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have also started to write my project proposal. It is still rough as I would like feedback on my initial ideas before committing to an area of research.</p>
<p>I have found evidence of research into both applications of GAs onto semi-autonomous road networks and the general use-cases of QGAs. I am yet to find a paper concerned with either applications of QGAs on semiautonomous road networks or applications of GAs onto fully autonomous road networks. Therefore, I am leaning towards researching the applications of GAs on fully autonomous road networks with a view to extend into QGAs (time and ability permitting).</p>
