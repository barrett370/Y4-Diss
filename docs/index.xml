      <description>This week I have been mainly gathering and reading academic papers surrounding GAs, Swarm Algorithms, QGAs and any research applying these areas onto routing or network optimisation.
I have started using Zotoro to keep track of any papers I have found. I am annotating papers as I read them so as to help me when I come to reference certain sections.
Papers Read:
 Quantum Genetic Optimization Quantum Genetic Algorithms for Computer Scientists  I have also started to write my project proposal.</description>

      <description>This week, I have been primarily concerned with researching possible project topics.
I had originally thought I would like to do research into nature inspired optimisation techniques and their potential applications in the world of fully autonomous road networks. Whilst this is still an area I am interested in, and would like to research, it has been suggested to me that it might be beneficial for me to choose a topic more closely related to my supervisor&amp;rsquo;s field of study.</description>
